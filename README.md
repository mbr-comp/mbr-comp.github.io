# Transferring Files from Windows to Linux using SSH, Filezilla, and SFTP.
## In this tutorial I will show you how to send files from one computer to another over a network connection.
### Recently I have had numerous stability issues on my Windows 11 PC, including random forced restarts among other issues. I wanted to backup all of my important data to another machine so that I could wipe the Windows computer clean and give it a fresh installation of Windows 11 in the hopes that it would solve at least some of the instability. The only problem is that I had between 100 and 200 GB of data to move and only 1 measly little 16 GB flash drive to move it with. That would have taken ages, and likely would have fried my usb drive in the process (those things have a limited number of reads and writes before they eventually give up the ghost). After some quick googling, I learned of SFTP, or SSH File Transfer Protocol, which enables a user to directly move data from any directory on a computer to another.
